**Day 2 (conference)**
Session: Optimize KPI reporting using Power BI metrics

In every organization it is important to be able to follow up on KPIs in order to understand how the business are doing. KPIs used in the business can often be found in existing Power BI reports, however, following up on KPIs across multiple reports are not effective. Instead you should use Power BI metrics where you easily can get an overview over KPIs that are relevant.
In this session we will take a deep dive into Power BI metrics, this include everything from creating KPIs, following up on KPIs, automating status on KPIs and consuming KPIs
